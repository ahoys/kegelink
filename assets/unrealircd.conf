/* Configuration file for UnrealIRCd 4
 *
 * Simply copy this file to your conf/ directory, call it
 * 'unrealircd.conf' and walk through it line by line (edit it!)
 *
 * Important: All lines, except the opening { line, end with an ;
 * including };. This is very important, if you miss a ; somewhere then
 * the configuration file parser will complain and your file will not
 * be processed correctly!
 * If this is your first experience with an UnrealIRCd configuration
 * file then we really recommend you to read a little about the syntax,
 * this only takes a few minutes and will help you a lot:
 * https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Configuration#Configuration_file_syntax
 *
 * UnrealIRCd 4 documentation (very extensive!):

/* UnrealIRCd makes heavy use of modules. Modules allow you to completely
 * customize the featureset you wish to enable in UnrealIRCd.
 * See: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Modules
 *
 * By using the include below we instruct the IRCd to read the file
 * 'modules.default.conf' which will load more than 150 modules
 * shipped with UnrealIRCd. In other words: this will simply load
 * all the available features in UnrealIRCd.
 * If you are setting up UnrealIRCd for the first time we suggest you
 * use this. Then, when everything is up and running you can come
 * back later to customize the list (if you wish).

/* Listen blocks define the ports where the server should listen on.

 *       'Address already in use' error and the ircd won't start.
 *       This means you MUST bind to a specific IP instead of '*' like:
 *       listen { ip 1.2.3.4; port 6667; };
 *       Of course, replace the IP with the IP that was assigned to you.
